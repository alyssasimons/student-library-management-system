# student-library-management-system

## Description

This student library management system was developed for my Software Engineering I class. The ideations of the project (requirements, analysis, and design), were collaboratively discussed in a team of 6 student peers. The system has functionalities intended to update book catalog, add/delete books, find patrons, and generate reports. I solely took on the responsibility of developing the GUI of the system in Java, specifically using the Java Swing library. With our strict time constraint (from ideations to final product), which took about 1 1/2 weeks, we define this project as provisional. 
The backend development of this code could use an actual database rather than what is currently shown.
